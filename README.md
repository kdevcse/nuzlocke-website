# NuzHub
This application will provide a way for users to track their Pokemon Nuzlocke Runs online and even live display their progress on the web to others. 

You can read more about Nuzlocke runs [here](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Nuzlocke_Challenge)

This site is at the very early stages of development, as I am currently experimenting with all of the capabilities a react application will provide in this context.

# On Build
- Run babel JSX preprocessor and move them to build directory
- Copy static files into build directory
- Website ran on build folder
